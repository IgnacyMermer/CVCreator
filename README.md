# CVCreator

This app was created using NodeJS for backend and ReactJS for frontend. 
The backend using PDFKit generates CVs and save it for the moment on backend folder.
The frontend using MaterialUI allows to fill all fields and send request for generate CV.
Of course, this project is not finished yet, it needs to connect frontend with backend using axios and return pdf as a buffer.
